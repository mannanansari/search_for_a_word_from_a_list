# search_for_a_word_from_a_list
This is a Spring MVC application to allow users to search for a word from a list. We would be using Thymeleaf as a template.
H2 is gonna be our datasource for storing the words.

#Steps to run the app
Through terminal execute -- mvn clean install
 
I have used apache-maven-3.6.3 version

Run command -- mvn -q spring-boot:run

Or setup the Application class as main class and start the application in an editor(intellij/eclipse)

Go to localhost:8080 and give word to search in the input box and click 'Search' to get the list of words starting from given input
